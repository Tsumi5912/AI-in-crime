			<h3><i>Algorithms are getting better at facial reconstructions from incomplete data. This may be relevant in forensic science. But it will also be useful for civilians and artists.</i></h3>
			  Lin Gao's team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has created an algorithm that can recreate an image from a simple drawing. The researchers used an available database of 17,000 celebrity photos and used existing software that step-by-step converts facial photographs into a black-and-white sketch. They then trained a neural network on pairs of the original photos and the resulting drawings.<br><br>

			  It was taught to recognise five features: each eye individually, the nose, the mouth and the rest of the face. Based on the sketch, the network recreates the most realistic photo possible, then glues the elements together. The result is very convincing. The only problem is the skin colour - the celebrity database contains mostly white people.<br><br>

			  The tool will certainly come in handy in forensics, where memory portraits of perpetrators are created - now it will be possible to create a realistic portrait based on the sketch of a police draughtsman. But the tool will also be appreciated by artists who create for games or films.<br><br>

			  The team now wants to train the artificial intelligence to recreate realistic images of objects based on the sketch.<br><br><br>
			  <h2>Based on a sketch by a police draughtsman, it will be possible to create a realistic portrait</h2><br><br>A team from Duke University has developed an algorithm to restore pixelated photos to their original sharpness. Such tools existed before, but they were limited in their effectiveness - when the resolution of the photo was less than eight times the original, there was little they could restore.<br><br>

That's because older methods simply guessed what combination of the original pixels might match the larger square that replaced them. A team of US researchers decided to take a different approach - they used a GAN, (generative adversarial network) neural network.
<br><br>
Such networks actually consist of two competing sub-networks (hence the "adversarial" in the name, otherwise related to the Polish "adversary"). In this case, one network generated high-resolution images of faces from blurred images, after which the other network decided whether they were convincing enough - that is, similar to the original.<br><br>

The US team's work allows it to reproduce images that are 64 times less than the original - that is, it can turn a photo with a resolution of just 16 by 16 pixels into one with a resolution of 1024 by 1024 pixels. Cynthia Rudin, team leader, claims that their method can even reconstruct details such as fine wrinkles, eyelashes, and light stubble.<br><br>

The researchers allay fears - they used artificially generated, yet realistic faces to train the network, and their method does not allow (for now) to reconstruct a photo from a camera, such as a surveillance camera, into a sharp portrait. For now, it can be used to generate realistic faces from a combination of squares. This was a "proof of concept" project, i.e. it was intended to demonstrate whether the creation of such an algorithm was at all possible.<br><br>

But the same principle on which the researchers based their algorithm could theoretically be used to recreate realistic pictures from low-resolution images. These could be faces, of course (which could be of interest to the security and safety industries), but such a technique could also be useful in microscopic research, astronomy or satellite image analysis. We can also assume that it will soon find its way into our mobile phones, as a 'space zoom' option that can sharpen details in images taken from a distance.<br><br>
