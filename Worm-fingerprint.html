			<h1><i>How machine learning helps solve the mystery of death</i></h1><br>
			  <h3>The art of devouring</h3><br>
It is estimated that a fly larva feeding on a dead body can consume up to 35 grams of protein per day. Insects that feed on decomposing remains, so-called necrophagous insects, colonise these remains in a well-defined way, and different insects are active at different stages of decomposition, which is crucial in forensic science. "Determining the time elapsed between death and the time the remains are revealed is one of the most important tasks of forensic medicine," - wrote Dr. Elżbieta Kaczorowska, Dr. Dorota Pieśniak and Prof. Zofia Szczerkowska in a paper titled "Entomological methods of determining the time of death" published by the Archives of Forensic and Criminalistic Medicine.<br><br>

One of the methods of determining the time of death is observation of necrophagous insects. Researchers continue to improve it. Recently - by introducing machine learning algorithms.
<br><br>
<h3>Three flies and a horse</h3><br>
To determine the time of death, specialists use a variety of methods, including biochemical and physicochemical methods. However, the decomposition of the corpse makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use these methods. For this reason, investigators and forensic specialists turn their attention to the larvae and maggots of worms, from which various flies and beetles hatch in succession (depending on the climate zone). Decomposing corpses provide a favourable environment for the development of specific groups of invertebrates. These species can lay eggs on corpses, from which larvae develop. Some of these larvae may later pupate.<br><br><br>
<h2>University at Albany researchers have developed a machine learning technique to more quickly identify worm species based on their "chemical fingerprints"</h2><br><br><br>
The study of insects feeding on corpses is nothing new. Records of the use of entomology in murder cases date back to the 13th century, and in 1767 Charles Linnaeus stated that 'three flies will eat a horse as quickly as a lion would'. The foundations for the development of forensic science were laid at the turn of the 20th century by the French scientist Jean-Pierre Mégnin, professor of zoology and author of La faune des cadavres (Fauna of the cadavres).<br><br>
<h3>Worm fingerprint</h3><br>
Depending on the climate, different insects decompose the corpse at different times. In temperate climates, certain fly families first appear on the dead body, then flies, and in the course of fat fermentation, beetles, butterflies and wrens. There are several stages of the so-called insect succession on the corpse. Based on entomological examinations, expert witnesses can both estimate the time of death and determine whether a person died in the place where his body was found. The problem is that larvae are difficult to identify and their culture is time-consuming and expensive.<br><br>

All the invertebrates mentioned produce chemicals appropriate to their species. For researchers, they are like fingerprints, because their laboratory analysis gives a picture of how long a corpse has been decomposing and when death might have occurred. The problem arises when mixtures of secretions from different necrophage species are submitted for analysis. This is where machine learning comes into play.<br><br>
<h3>Algorithm for recognition</h3><br>
Researchers at the University at Albany (UA) have developed a machine learning technique to more quickly identify worm species from their 'chemical fingerprints'.<br><br>

In a paper with the long and convoluted title 'Identifying species components of populations of worms that feed on decomposing remains - facilitating the determination of post-mortem interval and time since tissue infestation by using machine learning and direct analysis in real-time mass spectrometry', Samira Beyramysoltan, Mónica I. Ventura, Jennifer Y. Rosati, Justine E. Giffen-Lemieux and Rabi A. Musah, researchers in the UA Department of Chemistry, described how machine learning facilitates the identification of worms. "The study demonstrates a novel, fast, easy and efficient approach to identifying worm species in field samples," they assessed.<br><br>

The team trained their computer programme using mixtures of different combinations of chemical secretions of six fly species. The scientists deciphered the chemical signatures of the insect larvae using a technique called mass spectrometry, which identifies chemicals by precisely measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of an electric ion.<br><br>
<h3>Almost flawlessly</h3><br>
After teaching the programme to recognise the chemical composition of each training mixture, the researchers determined whether it could identify 'test' chemical mixtures. The programme accurately identified most of the test samples, suggesting that the technique could help investigators determine the time of death. The results of this research were published in the latest issue of Analytical Chemistry.<br><br>

Insect larvae were immersed in a 70 per cent ethanol solution, which was exposed to ions emitted by a spectrometer so that chemical signatures of both individual species and combinations of species could be obtained. Mixtures of two, three, four, five and six different species were analysed in turn.<br><br>

From the chemical profiles produced, a predictive model was created for the subsequent identification of tissue samples of unknown insects. As it turned out, using this model, specific species of larvae could be identified with an accuracy of up to 94 percent.<br>
