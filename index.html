			<h3><i>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to exhibit human skills such as reasoning, learning, planning and creativity.</i></h3>
              Artificial intelligence enables technical systems to perceive their environment, deal with what they perceive and solve problems, working towards a specific goal. A computer receives data (already prepared or collected by its sensors, such as a camera), processes it and reacts.
             AI systems are able to adapt their behaviour to some extent by analysing the effects of previous actions and acting autonomously.

			Some artificial intelligence technologies have existed for more than 50 years, but advances in computing power, the availability of massive amounts of data and new algorithms have led to major breakthroughs in this field. Artificial intelligence is seen as central to the digital transformation of society and has become an EU priority. Its future applications are expected to bring huge changes, but artificial intelligence is already present in our daily lives.

                  <h2>Face-painting algorithm</h2>
Lin Gao's team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has created an algorithm that can recreate an image from a simple drawing. The researchers used an available database of 17,000 celebrity photos and used existing software that step-by-step converts facial photographs into a black-and-white sketch. They then trained a neural network on pairs of the original photos and the resulting drawings.  <b><i><a href="Face-painting-algorithm.html">

                  <h2>Crime scene investigation</h2>
				  Recently, researchers at the University of Leon, in north-west Spain, have been training neural networks to detect clues left at the crime scene. This is done by feeding thousands of images from crime scenes into the computer so the machine learning algorithms will know what they need to detect. This includes possible patterns used by criminals in different situations, which could connect all of the crimes to one person. <b><i><a href="Using-AI-to-Fight-Crime.html"> READ MORE
